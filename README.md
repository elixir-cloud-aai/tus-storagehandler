## Usage

1. **Install cruft** (if you haven't already):

```sh
pip install cruft
```

2. **Generate a New Project**:

```sh
cruft create https://github.com/elixir-cloud-aai/cookiecutter-python.git
```

### Don't wanna use cruft?

You can also use the `cookiecutter` command directly:

1. **Install cookiecutter** (if you haven't already):

```sh
pip install cookiecutter
```

2. **Generate a New Project**:

```sh
cookiecutter gh:elixir-cloud-aai/cookiecutter-python
```

> **Note**: If you're using just `cookiecutter`, manually remove
  `update-template` job from `update.yaml` github action workflow file as
  `cookiecutter` doesn't support autosync like cruft.

## Configurations

### Package manager - Poetry

This project uses [Poetry][poetry-org] as a package manager. Check out the
commands at the [official documentation][poetry-docs].

### Linters and formatters - Ruff

To lint and format `Python` code files, it uses [Ruff][ruff], the default
configuration is set in the `pyproject.toml` file.

```toml
select = [
  "B", # flake8-bugbear
  "E", # pycodestyle
  "F", # Pyflakes
  "I", # isort
  "PL", # pylint
  "SIM", # flake8-simplify
  "UP", # pyupgrade
]
```

To configure it to your needs, refer to the [rules documentation][rudff-linter]
, and for formatter configuration, refer to the
[configuration documentation][ruff-formatter].

### Spell checker - Typos

If you want to ignore certain words, add them to the `pyproject.toml` file,
under the `tool.typos.default.extend-words` key.

```toml
[tool.typos.default.extend-words]
mke = 'mke'
```

For further configuration, refer to the [typos docs][typos-docs].

### Static type checker - Mypy

Change the configuration in `pyproject.toml` file, for further information refer to
the [documentation][mypy-config].

### Documentation - Sphinx

Configuration for Sphinx is in the `docs/source/conf.py` file, for further info refer
to the [Sphinx documentation][sphinx-docs]. The default configuration uses
[furo theme][furo] and [ReadTheDocs][rtd] to host the documentation, you can
change the configuration using `/docs/source/conf.py` and `.readthedocs.yml`
file.

> **Note**: Make sure to setup the `ReadTheDocs` account and add the project to
  the account to host the documentation.

### Testing - pytest and pytest-cov

Generate a coverage report using `pytest-cov` and uploads it to codecov.io.

> **Note**: Make sure to setup the `Codecov` account and add the project to the
  account to host the coverage report and add github [token](#cicd---github-actions).

## CI/CD - GitHub Actions

Here are the GitHub Actions Secrets that need to be included in the repository
settings:

- `PYPI_PASSWORD`: PyPI account password.
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: Codecov token.
- `AUTO_UPDATE_GITHUB_TOKEN`: GitHub token with permissions to write to the repository.

## Disclaimer

Some of the links and images have been hardcoded with `ELIXIR Cloud & AAI`'s
assets in the documentation, please update them manually if needed. These
assets **MUST** be included for projects owned by ELIXIR Cloud & AAI, but
**MUST NOT** be included for projects that are not (personal projects, projects
owned by other orgs).

**Only`markdown` files and `images/` directory need to be changed.**
