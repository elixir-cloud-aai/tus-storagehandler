## Synopsis
This application provides endpoints for uploading, downloading, and listing files in a MinIO bucket, with TUS protocol support for uploads, and CORS enabled for cross-origin requests.

## Basic Usage

## Installation

### Prerequisites

This flask application requires a running instance of [minio](https://min.io/download)

Run the minio instance by executing the following command in the location where minio is installed

```sh
minio server /data --console-address ":9001"
```

### Install Dependencies using Poetry

1. **Download the required dependencies**

   Navigate to the folder `tus_storagehandler`.

2. **Install Poetry**

   If you haven't already, install Poetry by following the instructions on the [Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

3. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (optional)**

   Poetry automatically creates and manages a virtual environment for your project. You can activate it using:
   ```sh
   poetry shell
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**

   Run the following command to install the dependencies defined in the `pyproject.toml` file:
   ```sh
   poetry install
   ```
  
## Development

For ease of use, certain scripts have been abbreviated in `Makefile`, make sure
that you have installed the dependencies before running the commands.

> **Note**: `make` commands are only available for Unix-based systems.

To view the commands available, run:

```sh
make
```

Here are certain commands that you might find useful:

- Make a virtual environment

```sh
make v
```

- Install all dependencies including optional dependencies

```sh
make i
```

> **Note**: This project uses optional dependency groups such as `types`,
> `code_quality`, `docs`, `vulnerability`, `test`, and `misc`. To install stubs
> or types for the dependencies, you **must** use the following command:
>
> ```sh
> poetry add types-foo --group types
> ```
>
> Replace `types-foo` with the name of the package for the types. All runtime
> dependencies should be added to the `default` group. For example, to install
> `requests` and its type stubs, run:
>
> ```sh
> poetry add requests
> poetry add types-requests --group types
> ```
>
> This ensures that the type checker functions correctly.
>
> **Note**: Since the dependencies are segregated into groups, if you add a new
> group make sure to add it in `make install` command in [Makefile](Makefile).

- Run tests

```sh
make t
```

- Run linter, formatter and spell checker

```sh
make fl
```

- Build the documentation

```sh
make d
```

> **Note**: If you make changes to the code, make sure to generate and push the
> documentation using above command, else the documentation check CI will fail.
> Do NOT edit auto-generated documentation manually.

- Run type checker

```sh
make tc
```

- Run all pre-commit checks

```sh
make pc
```

- Update the cookiecutter template

```sh
make u
```

> **Note**: This is not the complete list of commands, run `make` to find out if
> more have been added.
